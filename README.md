- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lynxtickler
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automating my daily computer usage by programming little scripts for everything.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been very interested in software architecture and mathematical programming lately.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: If you're reading this, I've probably given you my contact information or you know me from Discord. There's a link to my LinkedIn profile in my info.
- Repos below are just a fraction of my work. However few are the scripts that make any sense by themselves. So most of my stuff isn't published.
